# kjv-bible-api

This is a project for CST-235. I really didn't want to do this in Java, so I didn't.

I'm fairly confident the text is parsed properly to json but if it isn't then just shoot a PR in or something. Hopefully nothing is missing though.

## Legal Stuff?

The raw utf-8 content for the King James Bible (kjv/kjb) was acquired from [The Project Gutenberg eBook of The King James Bible](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/10/10-0.txt). This can be seen within the files named `kjv-new.[txt/json]` and `kjv-old.[txt/json]` which have been modified for parsing.

See their license at the bottom of the [file](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/10/10-0.txt) for information about their license if you plan to use/distribute/sell any part(s) of this codebase using their text.
