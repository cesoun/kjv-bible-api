and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.","9":"When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.","10":"When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.","11":"And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.","12":"And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.","13":"And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.","14":"When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:","15":"And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.","16":"Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.","17":"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,","18":"In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.","19":"But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,","20":"Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child’s life.","21":"And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.","22":"But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:","23":"And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene."},"3":{"1":"In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,","2":"And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.","3":"For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.","4":"And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins;

A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.","15":"Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.","16":"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.","17":"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.","18":"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.","19":"Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.","20":"For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.","21":"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:","22":"But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.","23":"Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;","24":"Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.","25":"Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.","26":"Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.","27":"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:","28":"But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.","29":"And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.","30":"And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.","31":"It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:","32":"But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.","33":"Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:","34":"But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:","35":"Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.","36":"Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.","37":"But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.","38":"Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:","39":"But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.","40":"And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.","41":"And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.","42":"Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.","43":"Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.","44":"But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;","45":"That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.","46":"For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?","47":"And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?","48":"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."},"6":{"1":"Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.","2":"Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.","3":"But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:","4":"That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.","5":"And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.","6":"But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.","7":"But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.","8":"Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.","9":"After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.","10":"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.","11":"Give us this day our daily bread.","12":"And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.","13":"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.","14":"For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:","15":"But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.","16":"Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.","17":"But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;","18":"That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.","19":"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:","20":"But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:","21":"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.","22":"The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.","23":"But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.","24":"If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!   No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.","25":"Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?","26":"Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?","27":"Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?","28":"And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:","29":"And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.","30":"Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?","31":"Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?","32":"(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.","33":"But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.","34":"Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."},"7":{"1":"Judge not, that ye be not judged.","2":"For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.","3":"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?","4":"Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?","5":"Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.","6":"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.","7":"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:","8":"For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.","9":"Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?","10":"Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?","11":"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?","12":"Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.","13":"Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:","14":"Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.","15":"Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.","16":"Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?","17":"Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.","18":"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.","19":"Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.","20":"Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.","21":"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.","22":"Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?","23":"And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.","24":"Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:","25":"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.","26":"And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:","27":"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.","28":"And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:","29":"For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes."},"8":{"1":"When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.","2":"And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.","3":"And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.","4":"And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.","5":"And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,","6":"And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.","7":"And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.","8":"The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.","9":"For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.","10":"When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.","11":"And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.","12":"But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","13":"And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.","14":"And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother laid, and sick of a fever.","15":"And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.","16":"When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:","17":"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.","18":"Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.","19":"And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.","20":"And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.","21":"And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.","22":"But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.","23":"And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.","24":"And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.","25":"And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.","26":"And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.","27":"But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!","28":"And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.","29":"And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?","30":"And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.","31":"So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.","32":"And he said unto them, Go.

A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.","29":"He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.","30":"And he came to the second, and said likewise.

And he was speechless.","13":"Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","14":"For many are called, but few are chosen.","15":"Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.","16":"And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.","17":"Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?","18":"But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?","19":"Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.","20":"And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?","21":"They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.","22":"When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.","23":"The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,","24":"Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.","25":"Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:","26":"Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.","27":"And last of all the woman died also.","28":"Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven?  for they all had her.","29":"Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.","30":"For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.","31":"But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,","32":"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.","33":"And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.","34":"But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.","35":"Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,","36":"Master, which is the great commandment in the law?","37":"Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.","38":"This is the first and great commandment.","39":"And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.","40":"On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.","41":"While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,","42":"Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David.","43":"He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,","44":"The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?","45":"If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?","46":"And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions."},"23":{"1":"Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,","2":"Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat:","3":"All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do;

I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.","35":"And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.","36":"And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.","37":"And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.","38":"And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house.","39":"And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.","40":"Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.","41":"And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.","42":"And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.","43":"And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.","44":"And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee."},"5":{"1":"And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,","2":"And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.","3":"And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.","4":"Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.","5":"And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.","6":"And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.","7":"And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.","8":"When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.","9":"For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:","10":"And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.","11":"And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.","12":"And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.","13":"And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.","14":"And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.","15":"But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.","16":"And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.","17":"And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.","18":"And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.","19":"And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.","20":"And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.","21":"And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?","22":"But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?","23":"Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?","24":"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.","25":"And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.","26":"And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.","27":"And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.","28":"And he left all, rose up, and followed him.","29":"And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.","30":"But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?","31":"And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.","32":"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.","33":"And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?","34":"And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?","35":"But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.","36":"And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old.","37":"And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.","38":"But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.","39":"No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better."},"6":{"1":"And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.","2":"And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?","3":"And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;","4":"How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?","5":"And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.","6":"And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.","7":"And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.","8":"But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.","9":"Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?","10":"And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.","11":"And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.","12":"And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.","13":"And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;","14":"Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,","15":"Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,","16":"And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.","17":"And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;","18":"And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.","19":"And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.","20":"And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.","21":"Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.","22":"Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.","23":"Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.","24":"But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.","25":"Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.","26":"Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.","27":"But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,","28":"Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.","29":"And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.","30":"Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.","31":"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.","32":"For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.","33":"And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye?  for sinners also do even the same.","34":"And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.","35":"But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.","36":"Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.","37":"Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:","38":"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom.

And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:","7":"Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.","8":"For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.","9":"When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.","10":"And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.","11":"And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.","12":"Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.","13":"And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.","14":"And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still.","15":"And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.","16":"And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.","17":"And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.","18":"And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.","19":"And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?","20":"When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?","21":"And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.","22":"Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.","23":"And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.","24":"And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see?  A reed shaken with the wind?","25":"But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?

And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.","9":"And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?","10":"And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.","11":"Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.","12":"Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.","13":"They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.","14":"And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.","15":"But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.","16":"No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.","17":"For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.","18":"Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.","19":"Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.","20":"And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.","21":"And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.","22":"Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.","23":"But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.","24":"And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.","25":"And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.","26":"And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.","27":"And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.","28":"When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.","29":"(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man.

And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.","31":"And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.","32":"And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.","33":"Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.","34":"When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.","35":"Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.","36":"They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.","37":"Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.","38":"Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,","39":"Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.","40":"And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.","41":"And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:","42":"For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.","43":"And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,","44":"Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.","45":"And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?","46":"And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.","47":"And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.","48":"And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.","49":"While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.","50":"But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.","51":"And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.","52":"And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.","53":"And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.","54":"And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.","55":"And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.","56":"And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done."},"9":{"1":"Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.","2":"And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.","3":"And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.","4":"And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.","5":"And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.","6":"And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.","7":"Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;","8":"And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.","9":"And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.","10":"And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.","11":"And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.","12":"And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.","13":"But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.","14":"For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.","15":"And they did so, and made them all sit down.","16":"Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.","17":"And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.","18":"And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?","19":"They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.","20":"He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.","21":"And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;","22":"Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.","23":"And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.","24":"For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.","25":"For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?","26":"For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father’s, and of the holy angels.","27":"But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.","28":"And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.","29":"And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.","30":"And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:","31":"Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.","32":"But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.","33":"And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.","34":"While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.","35":"And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.","36":"And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.","37":"And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.","38":"And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.","39":"And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.","40":"And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.","41":"And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.","42":"And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him.","43":"And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,","44":"Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.","45":"But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.","46":"Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.","47":"And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,","48":"And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.","49":"And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.","50":"And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.","51":"And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,","52":"And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.","53":"And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.","54":"And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?","55":"But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.","56":"For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.","57":"And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.","58":"And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.","59":"And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.","60":"Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.","61":"And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.","62":"And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."},"10":{"1":"After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.","2":"Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.","3":"Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.","4":"Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.","5":"And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.","6":"And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.","7":"And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire.

he had bound him.","30":"On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their

me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?","4":"And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?","5":"Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.","6":"But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.","7":"And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.","8":"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.","9":"And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees’ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.","10":"And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.","11":"And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.","12":"And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.","13":"And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.","14":"And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.","15":"Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.","16":"And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.","17":"Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.","18":"So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.","19":"Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?","20":"And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.","21":"But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.","22":"So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.","23":"And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;","24":"And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.","25":"And he wrote a letter after this manner:","26":"Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.","27":"This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.","28":"And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:","29":"Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.","30":"And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.","31":"Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.","32":"On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:","33":"Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.","34":"And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;","35":"I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come.

when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.","26":"He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.","27":"But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound."},"25":{"1":"Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.","2":"Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,","3":"And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.","4":"But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.","5":"Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.","6":"And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.","7":"And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.","8":"While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.","9":"But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?","10":"Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.","11":"For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.","12":"Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.","13":"And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.","14":"And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:","15":"About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.","16":"To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.","17":"Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.","18":"Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:","19":"But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.","20":"And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.","21":"But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.","22":"Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.","23":"And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul was brought forth.","24":"And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.","25":"But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.","26":"Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.","27":"For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him."},"26":{"1":"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself.","2":"I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:","3":"Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.","4":"My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;","5":"Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.","6":"And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, unto our fathers:","7":"Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come.

And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.","16":"But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;","17":"Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,","18":"To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.","19":"Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:","20":"But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.","21":"For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.","22":"Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:","23":"That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.","24":"And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.","25":"But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.","26":"For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.","27":"King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.","28":"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.","29":"And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.","30":"And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:","31":"And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.","32":"Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar."},"27":{"1":"And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus’ band.","2":"And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.","3":"And the next day we touched at Sidon.

nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.","9":"Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,","10":"And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.","11":"Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.","12":"And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.","13":"And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.","14":"But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.","15":"And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.","16":"And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:","17":"Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship;

thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.","25":"Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.","26":"Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.","27":"But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;","28":"And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.","29":"Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.","30":"And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,","31":"Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.","32":"Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.","33":"And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.","34":"Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.","35":"And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.","36":"Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.","37":"And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.","38":"And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.","39":"And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.","40":"And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.","41":"And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.","42":"And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.","43":"But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose;

who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.","8":"And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.","9":"So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:","10":"Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.","11":"And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.","12":"And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.","13":"And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:","14":"Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.","15":"And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.","16":"And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.","17":"And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.","18":"Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.","19":"But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar;

God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.","14":"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.","15":"For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.","16":"If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.","17":"Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.","18":"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.","19":"For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.","20":"Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.","21":"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.","22":"For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:","23":"But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.","24":"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?","25":"I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?","18":"But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.","19":"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.","20":"For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.","21":"Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;","22":"Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.","23":"Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.","24":"Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand."},"2":{"1":"But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.","2":"For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?","3":"And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.","4":"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.","5":"But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.","6":"Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.","7":"So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.","8":"Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.","9":"For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.","10":"To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;","11":"Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.","12":"Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,","13":"I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.","14":"Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.","15":"For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:","16":"To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?","17":"For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ."},"3":{"1":"Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?","2":"Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:","3":"Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.","4":"And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:","5":"Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;","6":"Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.","7":"But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:","8":"How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?","9":"For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.","10":"For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.","11":"For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.","12":"Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:","13":"And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:","14":"But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.","15":"But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.","16":"Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.","17":"Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.","18":"But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD."},"4":{"1":"Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;","2":"But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.","3":"But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:","4":"In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.","5":"For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake.","6":"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.","7":"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.","8":"We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;","9":"Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;","10":"Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.","11":"For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.","12":"So then death worketh in us, but life in you.","13":"We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;","14":"Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.","15":"For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.","16":"For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.","17":"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;","18":"While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal."},"5":{"1":"For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.","2":"For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:","3":"If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.","4":"For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.","5":"Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.","6":"Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:","7":"(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)","8":"We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.","9":"Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.","10":"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.","11":"Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.","12":"For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.","13":"For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.","14":"For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:","15":"And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.","16":"Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.","17":"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.","18":"And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;","19":"To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.","20":"Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.","21":"For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."},"6":{"1":"We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.","2":"(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)","3":"Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:","4":"But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,","5":"In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;","6":"By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,","7":"By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,","8":"By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;","9":"As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;","10":"As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.","11":"O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.","12":"Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.","13":"Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged.","14":"Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?","15":"And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?","16":"And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.","17":"Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.","18":"And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty."},"7":{"1":"Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.","2":"Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.","3":"I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.","4":"Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.","5":"For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.","6":"Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;","7":"And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.","8":"For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.","9":"Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.","10":"For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.","11":"For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.","12":"Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.","13":"Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.","14":"For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.","15":"And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.","16":"I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things."},"8":{"1":"Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;","2":"How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.","3":"For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;","4":"Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.","5":"And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.","6":"Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.","7":"Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.","8":"I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.","9":"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.","10":"And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.","11":"Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.","12":"For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.","13":"For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:","14":"But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:","15":"As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.","16":"But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.","17":"For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.","18":"And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;","19":"And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:","20":"Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:","21":"Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.","22":"And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.","23":"Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.","24":"Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf."},"9":{"1":"For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:","2":"For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.","3":"Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:","4":"Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.","5":"Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.","6":"But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.","7":"Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.","8":"And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:","9":"(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.","10":"Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)","11":"Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.","12":"For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;","13":"Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;","14":"And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.","15":"Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift."},"10":{"1":"Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:","2":"But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.","3":"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:","4":"(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)","5":"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;","6":"And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.","7":"Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ’s, even so are we Christ’s.","8":"For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:","9":"That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.","10":"For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.","11":"Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.","12":"For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.","13":"But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.","14":"For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:","15":"Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,","16":"To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand.","17":"But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.","18":"For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth."},"11":{"1":"Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.","2":"For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.","3":"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.","4":"For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.","5":"For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.","6":"But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.","7":"Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?","8":"I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.","9":"And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.","10":"As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.","11":"Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.","12":"But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.","13":"For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.","14":"And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.","15":"Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.","16":"I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.","17":"That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.","18":"Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.","19":"For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.","20":"For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.","21":"I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.","22":"Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.","23":"Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.","24":"Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.","25":"Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;","26":"In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;","27":"In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.","28":"Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.","29":"Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?","30":"If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.","31":"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.","32":"In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:","33":"And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands."},"12":{"1":"It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.","2":"I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.","3":"And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)","4":"How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.","5":"Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.","6":"For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.","7":"And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.","8":"For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.","9":"And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.","10":"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.","11":"I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.","12":"Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.","13":"For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.","14":"Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.","15":"And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.","16":"But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.","17":"Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?","18":"I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?","19":"Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.","20":"For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:","21":"And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed."},"13":{"1":"This is the third time I am coming to you.

even as it came to pass, and ye know.","5":"For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.","6":"But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:","7":"Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:","8":"For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.","9":"For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;","10":"Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?","11":"Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.","12":"And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:","13":"To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints."},"4":{"1":"Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.","2":"For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.","3":"For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:","4":"That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;","5":"Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:","6":"That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.","7":"For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.","8":"He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.","9":"But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.","10":"And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;","11":"And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;","12":"That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.","13":"But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.","14":"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.","15":"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.","16":"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:","17":"Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.","18":"Wherefore comfort one another with these words."},"5":{"1":"But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.","2":"For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.","3":"For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.","4":"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.","5":"Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.","6":"Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.","7":"For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.","8":"But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.","9":"For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,","10":"Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.","11":"Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.","12":"And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;","13":"And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. And be at peace among yourselves.","14":"Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.","15":"See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.","16":"Rejoice evermore.","17":"Pray without ceasing.","18":"In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.","19":"Quench not the Spirit.","20":"Despise not prophesyings.","21":"Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.","22":"Abstain from all appearance of evil.","23":"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.","24":"Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.","25":"Brethren, pray for us.","26":"Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.","27":"I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.","28":"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen."}}},{"title":"The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians","chapters":{"1":{"1":"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:","2":"Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.","3":"We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;","4":"So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:","5":"Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:","6":"Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;","7":"And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,","8":"In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:","9":"Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;","10":"When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.","11":"Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:","12":"That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."},"2":{"1":"Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,","2":"That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.","3":"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;","4":"Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.","5":"Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?","6":"And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.","7":"For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.","8":"And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:","9":"Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,","10":"And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.","11":"And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:","12":"That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.","13":"But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:","14":"Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.","15":"Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.","16":"Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,","17":"Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work."},"3":{"1":"Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:","2":"And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.","3":"But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.","4":"And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.","5":"And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.","6":"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.","7":"For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;","8":"Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nought;
